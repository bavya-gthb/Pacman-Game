# Pacman-Game
🟡 Pac-Man (Pygame Edition)

A Pac-Man-inspired game built using Python and Pygame, featuring dynamic gameplay, smart ghost AI, and multiple levels. Navigate Pac-Man through the maze, collect food, avoid ghosts, and complete increasingly challenging levels.

🎮 Features

Classic Gameplay: Control Pac-Man using arrow keys to collect food while avoiding ghosts.

Progressive Levels:

Level 1 – Single ghost chases Pac-Man across the screen.

Level 2 – Two ghosts patrol separate regions (upper and lower halves).

Level 3 – Four ghosts guard their own quadrants with randomly generated walls.

Smart Ghost AI: Ghosts chase Pac-Man intelligently and avoid walls and other ghosts.

Collision Detection: Prevents Pac-Man from overlapping with walls, ghosts, or food.

Dynamic Food Spawning: Food appears in open spaces, never inside walls.

Celebration Effect: Particle explosion animation when all levels are completed.
